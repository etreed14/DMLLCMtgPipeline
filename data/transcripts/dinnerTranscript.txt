w it down, make money on the aftermarket, as opposed to losing money on the area. So the production rate from the 20 to 46-year-old is better, but I couldn't do it 100% of the way.  



Speaker 2 [00:00:14] I think it could slow, but it's going to slow for a much higher level. I think that $89 million worth of gas will work.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:00:27] They can't really slow it unless they're surprised. Yes, they've got delivery. They've got deliveries. They've actually got delivery milestones. And there are five years that they missed.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:00:37] So guys order your bread, then I gotta take control. Good job, bitches.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:00:45] This one, I think it was. What?  

 

Speaker 4 [00:00:50] So, Greg, come on, Rick.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:00:53] I'm good with my car, buddy.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:00:56] I'm drinking them. I mean, so are we though. And eating them.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:01:00] You can get to it.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:01:02] This is my third night in a row I've actually been out. Yeah, I got hurt. I was hurt in Boston on Monday and Tuesday. Well, no, Tuesday here, but it's been a run.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:01:17] The boys were off, so I was in New Jersey, but then I came back for dinner last night.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:01:24] Yeah.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:01:31] Let me have one of these guys and one of the loading up on the car. Thank you very much.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:01:41] So.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:01:42] All right, that was my answer. Thanks a lot, everybody.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:01:46] I would, but I haven't.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:01:49] I am a little worried about coffee and like the other places we went. No problem.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:01:56] They've moved against the production market.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:01:58] At this point.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:01:59] I got to go. Go! Sorry, I had two drinks ready. It's like a lot for me. I don't even fucking sleep in 50 minutes. You're gonna have to take over.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:02:16] What do you got, Rick? I'm trying to feel out the crowd, like, you know, what level of controversy and...  

 

Speaker 6 [00:02:22] You're having that conversation?  

 

Speaker 2 [00:02:23] Fire and Brimstone, you guys, uh... I'm an activist, so Machaversis is great. Oh, you're an activist? Oh my god, we got...  

 

Speaker 5 [00:02:33] See ya!  

 

Speaker 4 [00:02:35] That's what I do. I put the value guy together with the activist.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:02:40] There you go. Let me make magic. So we have Southwest, which has obviously already been covered. We have CBS, which is obviously activist also, somewhat. I don't think we have left this activist territory. It's one of our smallest positions, this tarot data. I know it. So you got somebody in there now, they got a new CFO who sold to, got a history of selling to private equity, pretty good maintenance business. It's been a shit show. So about a decade or more. Until last year we've done a really good job of trading the stock and then this last move from like 32 to 22 left the mark. Who's in there? Small to small.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:03:41] Do you see? Who is he? Who IS he?  

 

Speaker 3 [00:03:45] I'll tell you. What it was now I'm sorry. Yeah, they already filed no if they filed they're in the  

 

Speaker 2 [00:03:59] It wasn't a material, you know, it wasn't like a material. But they had an issue. Wasn't one of the names. Yeah, it was one of names. You've got a maintenance business that's really good. The bulk case on it is the customers will say that, you know we hate them because they metastasize. You know, meaning you can't get rid of them. The only one I see is Lynn Rockway. She's an activist. It's a woman who you get  

 

Speaker 4 [00:04:31] Oh, I've heard of her. Do you feel like she's been there a long time? No, she's only been there the last year. She owns almost 10%, just under 10%.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:04:43] And it's been increasing it. Yeah, so, you know, we've got a new CFO who has sold the private equity before. I mean, the market should be doing well. You would think that the transition from AI, from hyper scalers to the enterprise, would benefit these guys eventually. You know, ideally you see like... How do you go through that? How does that work? I mean, there's a lag, right? I mean you've got hyperscalers that are deploying large language models now. At the enterprise level, they're gonna be more vertical, key-oriented models, smaller models, more inference. And so you're starting to see consulting activity pick up for AI, right. So there's Accenture, EPAM, Cognizant. And so it seems like the next couple of years, we see some inflection in terms of enterprise adoption to AI, should be a rising tide, should good for Snowflake, should be good for Caridata, you know, at the margin, and they've got this huge install base of the Fortune 100 companies, and so, you know, the reality is I think most solutions are going to need to be not Just cloud only, but hybrid solutions. We saw the Informatica deal, I mean, if you value it on the maintenance, it's worth $35-$37. You value it, you know, on a reasonable maintenance multiple. So that said, I'll admit, we haven't added, we'll probably add to it this summer. But we haven't added to it recently, I didn't play in the picture, but I think it's definitely one that's one third pregnant and I think you've got fewer obstructions for them to do a deal. Private equity should pay north of 34, I would think. No, so it's teradata, so the thing about it is, so they do... So when you get your fraud alerts, they were really good at that. So if, for example, somebody used their credit card in two locations, 100 miles apart, you need like real-time, immediate alerts, the banks do, they do a lot of that, they do a lots of the compliance type of work, you know, for the books.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:07:16] My stupid question just got recorded.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:07:18] Let me tell you, I wish Paradigm was an activist artist at some point and got cheap because that is one of the great businesses of all time.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:07:29] Thank you. Okay. Not so stupid. I love pterodactyl.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:07:33] Don't worry, it's not on me.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:07:34] Yeah, that's right. I am Sager.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:07:39] Wrong d-  

 

Speaker 2 [00:07:41] Well, I'm good, Dad. It's one of my smallest positions, but probably going to add to it.  

 

Speaker 7 [00:07:49] What would you evaluate if you included the value of the cloud business and all that stuff?  

 

Speaker 2 [00:07:57] $60 to $70. I mean, it's not unreasonable to get the $450 of free gas loan. They've been investing in the business a bit, but...  

 

Speaker 5 [00:08:12] Bye-bye!  

 

Speaker 2 [00:08:14] Listen, I was trimming the stock at $50 a year and a half ago, to just build the whole fucking thing. But, you know, it's not unreasonable to get to the corner, plus a million in pre-cash flow, you put a 20-mole price, and you get a $60 stock. Definitely a regular, good-for-a-me guy. I mean, they have a low-cost provider, they're fully interested in customers. Challenges Google, Amazon, a lot of the activity going on now is with unstructured data, right? So they do both structured and unstructured data, but they do mostly structured data. When you look at what enterprises are doing, super high liability stuff, you want more structured data, yeah. Large language models, you get away with the unstructured data. So, you know what I mean, the second the large language models add value.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:09:06] The structured data, you don't need models for.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:09:09] You'll do it cheaper on using any of the other algorithms. So that's why the transition to enterprise where, you know, that level of, you know, three nines of reliability shouldn't benefit these guys. They have better clean data. That said, I mean, stock's been a bit of a shit show.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:09:30] What underpins the valuation for somebody who's looking at it and saying, like, can I underwrite this?  

 

Speaker 2 [00:09:42] They've got a business that's very recurring, maintenance, you can't, it's not like you can download software to replace them, you know what I mean, it is a very bespoke customized solution. Why isn't trading at 22 today? Inability to grow the business and right now all the growth has been on the unstructured side so they are participating in the cloud piece of the business but you know enterprises haven't really you know pushed into AI in that way it's been more of the hyperscalers  

 

Speaker 8 [00:10:18] You didn't miss us, did you?  

 

Speaker 2 [00:10:20] I mean, that's safe. Yeah. It's kind of tough. Minutes of C-plus at best. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:10:32] Uhhh, I am Sumo. Hahahaha. Hahahaha! Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha  

 

Speaker 2 [00:10:52] I think it's definitely one you need some work on.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:10:55] I think I am a little horny. You don't have to redact the shit out of those transfers.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:11:11] I don't want any of my colors changing He's getting good signal.  

 

Speaker 8 [00:11:20] Is there a compliance cutoff? Yeah, yeah, yeah. G13 rated R. Go Brad. You're like, go. Stop somebody.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:11:31] Somebody's laughing somewhere. We just don't know where  

 

Speaker 1 [00:11:35] Probably an idea. Probably an Idea.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:11:39] It's not real. All right, so that's three. Can we get that up and up? Yeah, it's like three. So you're going to say, I made it.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:11:51] What do you think you got to say? One circle back, we don't have to hit you on it, totally.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:11:57] I mean, you are CMT. I don't care where you are. What do you love? I still love morning here. You know, the renewable story. So I think there's a big mispricing in renewables here. And I think we're going to get it cleared in the next few weeks from the House when the Senate comes out. They're killing all these residential solar projects. Who does this shit? Fundamentally huge demand for energy right now takes three to five years to bring up natural gas five to seven years Solar takes over 18 months. You look at all the all the electricity added to the grid the last few years 80% of it was solar and renewables. The next three years same thing Google meta Are chasing power and you know, you've got this negative halo of renewables kind of created by Trump, which applies to EVs and residential, but doesn't apply to the data center business at all, or utility scale solar, even if they give it in subsidies, it will be fucking irrelevant, nobody gives a shit, like they need power, and so I like AES recording here. AES is...  

 

Speaker 4 [00:13:19] Yeah, I meant to ask you about it. We never got you to talk about it  

 

Speaker 2 [00:13:24] EESA utility, half of it is renewables, solar. There's two utilities that really deliver renewables and next year on EES, they just signed a deal with Metta. So, EES did? Yeah, pretty big backlog. But you've got this IRA concern that they're gonna kill renewable subsidies, which just doesn't fucking matter. You just need to get the details out there. If they kill credits, they'll just use tax equity. You know, this is the only, you can't invest in meta or hyperscalers, you know, unless you believe that they're going to be able to deliver the energy to these companies. It's mutually exclusive, so either they're going to get the energy there or not. Renewables is the only option in the next couple of years. You got two guys that do it well, which is the next era, and yes Business is doing well People can't figure out like oh, you know, what's what's going on in renewables in light of the administration?  

 

Speaker 4 [00:14:29] What's the snapshot investment case for AES?  

 

Speaker 2 [00:14:33] So, I mean, you normalize the book value, you got $22 of book value to $11 stock, you know, they sold out to $20.99. You're going to see the renewables business, it's two to three years old, start to kick off a lot better even though it went forward. And you get a pretty good re-rating pace. But I think we just need the renewals overhang to go away with whatever legislative action.  

 

Speaker 9 [00:15:01] Really just see the tweets today, it's not going away.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:15:05] You need to go away. You need something to happen today. That's the way it comes. How do you feel about New York? I mean, you saw the constellation. I mean all that stuff is super long. I mean like, I love real Williams, right? Natural gas. It's amazing. Williams is a great natural gas story. I love it. But the reality is, you know, I mean there's a three-year backlog on natural gas turbines right now, right. Williams is a great five-year story, but...  

 

Speaker 1 [00:15:42] If you get everything the race story-wise approved today, how long would it be to get, like, a plan out? So this is really not the labor. All the labor is...  

 

Speaker 6 [00:15:52] Nobody knows how to build them, that's the biggest problem. Everybody that built a nuclear plant is in their 80s. And so the biggest problems people have, you'll be able to know more about them than I do.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:16:04] We got a matter to try to them.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:16:07] You know, it's funny to say that, the type that the specs they built to in China and Russia look so different, completely unhelpful. You can steal them all you want, they're just not going to help what we're trying to do. Yeah, it is a real weird problem on the labor front. It gets even stranger. It's not that it's DOA, it just takes a little longer. It takes a bit longer, it takes more money. Now by the way, the question I did have for you on the renewables is base load. To do full base load, you need maybe ships under solar, plus ships under wind, plus good batteries.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:16:45] I don't know, you do need batteries, or you just need natural gas, I mean, I'm not a green investor in any, you know, we own Philip Morris, you're not an ESG investor, but, you know renewables is the only choice to bring up power in the near term, and what people don't realize is if you're a big hyperscaler. Get 16 hours a day from renewables, do the best battery, you do it natural gas, turbines, you know, temporary. You can't buy a 10-year natural gas forward contract, right? So if you're a big hyperscaler, the neat thing about solar is you know what the price of it is now. As much as I love Williams, you don't know what the price for natural gas is gonna be, you know I mean, in eight to 10 years. So if wanna hedge that out. You've got to pay a pretty big forward contract rate, which is expensive to do that. So renewable is not going to be the 100% solution, but it is going to the base load solution in many cases. But it's just going to augment this with batteries.  

 

Speaker 10 [00:18:05] I totally agree with you, but we actually do think the Bitcoin miners have a role to play in energy availability right now.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:18:24] Thank you, Rick.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:18:25] Let's go.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:18:27] Fuck up my speaker  

 

Speaker 2 [00:18:30] I mean, no matter what the Senate comes out with, AES is going to grip on it.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:18:42] So just since we have activist investors here, one, I mean, there are two activist names that I'm more involved in. One is Lam West and Janice sort of got that in the hand. I think we'll likely see a catalyst here in the September timeframe when they get. 100% of the board seats if the company doesn't sell itself in advance of that. I think the management team clearly wants to stay in the job. So it behooves them to sell the company to another industrial player in the business and therefore they would retain their seats and operate the business. If not, they'll take severance. They're going to lose their jobs when the board turns over. And Jana already has both an executive chairman and the next CEO coming in, who have great track records. They're gonna be picking this up at the cyclical trough in the business. And they're going to be able to bring a lot of process improvements, capital allocation improvements to the business. So there are a couple of ways to win there. Yeah, it's an excellent set up. The CEO has already heard of their...  

 

Speaker 9 [00:20:15] You're talking about the internal one that they've already put in, right?  

 

Speaker 3 [00:20:20] No, no. As part of Janet's slate, one of the guys who was part of their program was an ex-senior executive. Yeah, there was already a CEO change that was affected by the company itself. That guy will not retain his position when Janet gets control of the boards.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:20:43] How's the URP going?  

 

Speaker 3 [00:20:46] ERP is fine. They've done everything outside of the actual plant level and they're holding off on moving forward and finishing up at the plant level. But everything associated with the distribution and logistics is all now SAP. Are they 100% on SAP, meaning they're really gathering all the benefits of it? I don't think so. I think their IT department was actually pretty lame, obviously, because they had this issue in the first place, but I don t think they ever put real capital into that.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:21:31] My, my, my... Is this a, is this a...  

 

Speaker 2 [00:21:36] Hannah upgrade story or?  

 

Speaker 3 [00:21:38] No, I just don't think that they've really, I don't, I don't they're maximizing the benefit. So the one I've gotten, that I've come to more recently, still don't have a full position, so still doing work on it, but I do a ton in semis. And I love what Starbird has set up here in Corvo. Corvo, so. They were investors in TriQuint, which was one half of the Corvo story, the other half was RFMD. RFM was a really troubled company for those of you guys who know semis. TriQuent had some phenomenal assets, defense assets, really high quality RF stuff that they were working on with Pentagon, the different defense agencies, some of the back ops type stuff. And I've been a very large holder for the last three or four years in Maycom, MTSI, which also has a very strong defense RF business. So I've gotten to know that company extremely well. And I feel like I know the defense side of the RF business quite well. So I own Tri-Quin. Starbird sort of pushed those two companies to merge and form Corvo. I stayed with Corvo, and I don't know why, but the stock absolutely exploded after they put the two businesses together. Everybody was looking for massive margin improvement. The stock exploded. I sold the stock after a bit of the run, left some on the table, but then shorted the company. Because I didn't really think that the current management team was the one that could realize the true benefits of that merger. And it's been a dog for the eight subsequent years after the stock peaked, with a couple of interludes where people got excited about what they could potentially do. So where are we today? So, Starbird owns just under 10% of the business. The company has gotten rid of one director that was there from the beginning. So after 10 years, stepped down from the board. They brought in two new directors. The company brought them in. These were not starboard directors. One is a current executive at Marvell, and he's got a good understanding of a lot of the areas where Marvell's business is involved in, right, so linear optics. AI and data center, and then somebody from NXP, a former senior executive from NxP. So that's the industrial side of the business, auto and industrial. And then Starboard advocated for one of their internal employees, their director of research and partner, to be put on the board as well, and the size of the board is 10 members, so starboard and The two new directors are effectively a third of the board, or close to a third of the Board. You've got an executive chairman who's 78 years old, and then you've got the CEO who's been there for 10 years, 67 years old and has really achieved absolutely nothing, certainly in terms of stock price appreciation over that decade long period. Here comes Starbird. What is Starbird going to do with this business? And if you don't know what the business is, 47% of sales come from Apple. Every year they have to fight it out with a couple of other RF companies for the latest iteration of the iPhone. Nobody likes that business. There's a constant threat that Apple is going to internalize some of those RF components, which they're not going to do. But they like to hang it out there and make everybody beat each other up. But the fact of the matter is that business generates reasonably acceptable gross margins. It's just they spend too much money trying to develop that next generation of product. And so their profitability on that business is suboptimal, but it also fills their FAFs. And that's okay. There is some benefit to having a recurring business that fills your FAFS, right? Then there's a piece of the business that's automotive, industrial, and defense. And it's effectively an analog business. Where they have margins way below any of the other analog players and that's where the real opportunity is. So they've just won some business, they're going to be in the new iPhone that comes out this fall, they are going to in the iPhone SE with the new PIMA card. So that's all decent business. Revisions are only going up, they aren't going down from here based on the core RF wireless business. Which frankly should either be combined with Skyworks business or Qualcomm's business. So I think over time you're going to see that RF business bulk up. Apple's not going to be happy about it, but in a way it benefits Apple even though they lose two companies that become one. So they lose a little bit of negotiation. You still have Broadcom that's fighting for that business. You still Murata that's fighting for the business. And in effect, you don't mind those two businesses coming together because they can put more money into R&D and Apple doesn't have to fund that themselves. The real opportunity is shrinking the footprint of their fabs. Fabs are underutilized. So you've got to close some of the fab capacity. You've got to get rid of some of the excess SG&A, and if you can get your margins back to where Skyworks are, you've got $350 million worth of savings. So you've done, and the stock is a double at that point. Now, do they break up the company by selling the RF business or merging it with Skyworks? I can see that as being very logical, and then you've an analog business. Where the margins can go up dramatically, and the market will put, right now the embedded value of that analog business is about two and a half times sales. Analog businesses trade anywhere from five to six times sales currently. So that business would rerate very dramatically and very quickly as those margin benefits flow through. Or. You decide you're going to operate the RF business and just improve that, shrink the fab footprint, kind of ride these improvements that have gotten you into the latest Apple products and you sell off the analog business for six times sales and now you just buy back stock. And, even if the multiple stays the same, the earnings leverage is pretty substantial on the RF business. I think it makes a lot more sense to merge RF with Skyworks and then isolate and either improve or sell the analog piece of the business. So, I don't see a lot of downside. Numbers are going up. The balance sheet is in really good shape. They will likely replace the CEO and The CEO is just, he's tired, he is lazy. He's been there for 10 years. He's got plenty of options. You can ease him out, I think, relatively easily and bring in somebody much more dynamic who will execute on that playbook. If you look at Starbird's history over the years in semis, it's probably where they've generated the highest ROICs on their investments. They have enough. Now sort of presence on the board and enough muscle in the stock to drive their playbook. And so to me, this one makes a tremendous amount of sense. Valuations are relatively low in a sector where valuations have escalated quite a bit. And frankly, you can be short, Sky works against it. There are other sort of RF plays that you can be short. You could be short some nulls, depending on the size of your physician. You could even be short ball com. I don't, I don't hate ball com, but I mean, it's not, it' not a bad head for something that is more dynamic and more immediate. Would you like to go by? Bye! I wouldn't completely preclude that happening, but I feel like Hock is a bit more focused on software acquisitions than he is in Semi. I think he's still a little burned about the Qualcomm situation, does not want to deal with China. In terms of approvals... And he's already in that business, so I think there'd be FTC issues as well as sort of China regulatory, so, I don't see, I dont see Hawke as a buyer.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:31:21] How long is starboard?  

 

Speaker 3 [00:31:22] Their 13-D was filed on January 17th and their cost basis is in the low 70s and the stock went out 77 today. So it's sort of up 10% from where they are. It's not something where you're paying 30% or 40% more than where they got in. So it doesn't, you know, again, this is a name. Corvo has burned a lot of different funds over the years with, you know, fits and starts. It looks like they're turning it around and yet it's not, it doesn't gel and then they've got to cut numbers again. They lose an iPhone cycle so they're underutilized until they try to get back into the one next year. And so people have sort of said, we just don't like consumer-related semis that have an RF component. We really don't want heavy Apple exposure. So those stocks are all cheap. I think there's sort of an internal restructuring story that... That sort of executes a playbook that Starbird has executed multiple times before with various semi-companies that generate much higher returns from the existing asset base, that you don't really have to worry too much about that perennial fit and start, you know, numbers go up and the numbers go down dramatically. It just, it's sort of just effected blocking and tackling, I think. Executing that playbook that's going to yield reasonable returns and your multiple gives you a margin of safety at today's entry.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:33:09] Are you thinking about Verizon on it? How long will it take for Sargo to get all this stuff done?  

 

Speaker 3 [00:33:15] It depends on how quickly they move the CEO out, right? And I think...  

 

Speaker 5 [00:33:22] Contention or is it like pretty, they're talking.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:33:26] I mean, they were able to get their guy on the board without putting out a letter, without putting on a slide deck, without doing a big presentation around it. So clearly there's receptivity on the Board. They moved that guy out who's been on for 10 years. They put in two real executives with semi-experience plus the starboard guy. It does tell you that Starbird feels like they need to be more hands-on, right? That they need a seat at the table, they need to be internal and see what's going on. So I don't think it's completely friendly, but it feels a lot less adversarial than other situations that they may have gotten involved in in the past, where they needed to do a big deck, they needed to put out a couple of letters and be a little bit more threatening. So I think in this one, you sort of have enough of an alignment of interests here that that program will move forward, whether it's executed under the existing CEO as part of his transition or under a new CEO. I think that remains to be seen, but I think you kind of win under both scenarios. So I like this one.  

 

Speaker 7 [00:34:47] Oh, I agree.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:34:50] How much? It went yellow.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:34:56] Yeah, I wouldn't yell at you. Yeah, let's go. Get in here, get in here!  

 

Speaker 7 [00:35:02] I think it might be tough to be a stand-alone public RFMD business. Totally agree. Even if you fix it operationally, you're not going to get the monthly reserve.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:35:14] It's a ten times business, at best. So I agree. It's got to be part of a larger business that's also going to create a ten-times earnings, but the synergies are going to yield a much higher EPS number.  

 

Speaker 7 [00:35:31] So yeah, the semi-businesses that trade well are the ones that have a portfolio of different shit. So that's the one thing, you get rid of this thing, get rid that thing, go up to this. I think it all kind of needs to go.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:35:44] Look, RF is not a tariff. People used to hate the DRAM business, right? I mean, we had 30 different global DRAM companies. Now we have three. And returns in the up cycles are phenomenal. I mean I'm a big micron shareholder right now. And if you can take the number of RF players from five to four and then four to three, suddenly returns look a little better, right. You can, you can actually. And look, Micron is never going to trade at 20 times earnings, that's okay. I mean if you can buy it at 8 times and watch it go to 12 and the earnings go up 75% in an up cycle, you can make a lot of money. So I think there are just multiple ways to win here and I don't see any institutional adversary That is going to stand in the way of executing this particular playbook, which has worked in the past and I think is really ideally suited to the situation we find ourselves in now.  

 

Speaker 7 [00:36:53] The very first stock I owned in this business, RFMD, when they merged with Cry Cry. Seriously? Very first stock. And then I went up 100% and I'm like, oh, this is so easy.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:37:05] I can do this!  

 

Speaker 4 [00:37:08] Thanks, Bob. We're going to sum up, because he's got a date.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:37:16] This is Sagar again, talking about outtakes. Gotta be careful. It's Sumo again. So I'm gonna pitch, well, you guys, consumer's okay? Oh yeah. I like Chipotle, so I was a little late, so just my background, we tend to do a lot of higher quality, growthy, longer duration type investing. So this is part of that. However, I believe it's wildly dislocated right now, which is what makes it super interesting to me. So, Chipotle, just background, the growth algorithm is about 8 to 10% unit growth, another sort of 2% pricing, 3% transaction growth, so you get sort of 15-ish percent top line growth, 20% EPS growth, that's sort of the growth algorithms. What's happened is they had an extremely strong first half of last year, everything it really well. And then you've had the perfect storm of Q1 where everything did not hit this first quarter. Traffic was terrible. You had 13 named storms in the Midwest. You had everything Trump-oriented, which has spooked all the consumers. It was the tax refunds, too. Late, late tax refund. I don't know how much of an impact it would have at $10 to $15 price points, but it certainly doesn't help sentiment to your point. So you put all that together and you had negative comp growth in Q1, which is extremely rare. The last two times they've had negative, comp growth was GFC and Tobi. So, spook the market. That's all you can do.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:39:05] Uh, yeah, I don't talk.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:39:12] So you put all that together and you're at, you know, stocks trading sort of in the mid-30s. This is a total 40 to 50 time stock, which on an earnings basis, which I know sounds expensive, but you have to remember, scarcity value for growth and consumer is just very high. So you just don't have that many like large cap growth stories. This is one of them. So what you have now to set up is you have a brand new management team that have been with the company forever, so they're not totally new, but they're new in the roles they have. Scott Boatwright, Adam Raman, I just met with them two days ago. They are, summer tends to be the non, believe it or not, the non-burrito season, so it tends to a weaker period for burrito sales. They're putting marketing dollars with sugar. Have a return over the summer, about $7 million incremental. On top of that, you also have the loyalty program. They have 45 million members, 25 million active, 20 million inactive. They're going to be reactivating those 20 million. So attach whatever you want to the front row one. A portion of them will come back. That shapes our top row. And then you have this fantastic group of stories where they've been. On average hitting about 22, 23, and I can walk you guys through the math later, but basically think of it as like, right now during peak periods, they hit 22,23 meals per peak period. Peak during 2014, 2015 was like third. So there's massive sort of productivity improvements that they can be doing and are doing right now. Some of that is through AI, a lot of that simple things where it's like truly just having an expo that helps provide everything. And so you put all of this together on 2027 numbers, I have two bucks stock at 38 times is probably 40% upside from here. Just counting it back in here as well. What is it now? So the stock right now is like $52. $52, yeah. And so on my numbers, it's trading at 25ish times. I think it should be trading close to the low, I mean, it should trading low 40s, but I'm putting a 38 times on it. That's my price target. And I think its a combination of accelerating comp growth from the back half of the year, which the company says they will be doing. And then you get the throughput in the next year. So you put all that together, I think this is eight plus asset. Still growing massively, that should trade well north of where it is. Are your estimates largely U.S. And maybe a little Canada? Thank you. Good point. I'm not assuming anything for Europe right now. They're talking a lot about Europe, and so it is very early days there, but I think this management team is much more focused on expanding and that kind of thing. So that's something to keep in mind.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:42:24] I think you need that. I mean, I do think you'd need that if it was just the US and Canada, you know, at some point, you get that multiple degradation, but if...  

 

Speaker 1 [00:42:34] I think that's probably like four years out, and I only say that because they have 37 years. They have 3,700 units right now, they think they can get to 7,000. So I think the white space in the U.S. Is still very high. Hit it all.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:42:57] What's the term?  

 

Speaker 1 [00:43:00] It gets heard on that and then the last dynamic to talk about which is related to this is like Such fun Hotel City like the rest of Mafia, which I'm sure you guys talked through  

 

Speaker 8 [00:43:19] And so, as soon as the reason is filled out.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:43:22] So as soon as that accelerates, which I think is going to happen in the next exercise.  

 

Speaker 8 [00:43:29] This thing's just too weird. Because of the traffic they've seen here, you're more caught than like the fact that honey chicken is out. Honey chicken, I think they've used it a little while. You're just stopping, like, on a slot. And you also had like 18% control last week.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:43:51] Have you tried the new sauce? I was at a restaurant dinner last night and everybody was talking about it. Have you try the new chipotle sauce?  

 

Speaker 1 [00:44:00] They do have an LTO coming out here, he said in the next couple days.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:44:09] The guys who were there had recreated the sauce themselves in their kitchen to try it and see if they thought it was going to be a hit.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:44:21] I don't know where that came from. All right, can I hit you with the, we had a dinner on Tuesday. Can I read just a bullet point and you respond to it? So it was a really short idea. Traffic deterioration is ongoing. Minus 2.3% in Q1 of this year. For the worst new trend into Q2. Limited time promotions. Honey chicken failing to improve customer visits materially. Pricing leverage declining amid rising competitive pressure. Reduced visit frequency among key demographic Millennials and Gen Z. Financial metrics, it's rich at 27 times VE at 23.6 times EB to EBITDA. Streets are overly optimistic, flat comps more likely versus guided, low single digit growth. Increased restaurant sector promotional intensity. Market underappreciates structural traffic and competitive risks strong institutional ownership may limit downside risk of traffic rebound similar to wink stop experience if promotions eventually resonate  

 

Speaker 9 [00:45:36] That was the sauce part, so they got a caveat that the sauce that hasn't come would re-accelerate traffic.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:45:47] On all of that, the guy said his thoughts, he's going to be the game that overcomes everything that this guy wants to capture in the song.  

 

Speaker 9 [00:45:59] Yeah, it's effective. He can't have it right now, see how soft.  

 

Speaker 3 [00:46:03] What makes it happen though i mean it happened once before with peso right so yeah so the sauce does matter oh it definitely matters it just has to be the right taste  

 

Speaker 9 [00:46:15] minigrat there are like pieces of minigrats, it's shocking the amount of people that have a minig rat that you can dump over your bowl and like that's that was a huge spiral tick-tock thing and it wasn't even healthy up  

 

Speaker 1 [00:46:27] So I'm going to sum up what you just said, but a couple of the points I would highlight are... It's not a TV question, it's a joke. The guy's been around. So, no, that was a joke, on the traffic point, 100% true, the comp is toughest in April, and then starts to ease in May, and we're starting to see the data starting to ease, which is why I think it's particularly interesting right now, Here's your starting to laugh. Super difficult compare that they would not be able to do. So it's sort of the situation where it's April's the worst and may get slightly easier and then it's really June that should inflect and then more importantly it's really the back half that should be much better and then they're putting the marketing balance to work and again this is a total you have to believe that this is a reasonable management chain. To want to invest in this because if they're putting marketing dollars to work or reactivating their customer base, you have to believe that that should re-accelerate the traffic trends that we should see. So that's one of them. On the LTO, you do have to look at their track record. So they've been doing LTOs for five years. They haven't had I'm not saying all of them hit as well as, like... Carne asada or whatever somehow. They've had a couple really good ones. Honey Chicken was okay, but it was laughing a very strong one last year. And so, but the way that they do it is very much like a stage gate approach. We'll test it in a couple markets, see if it works for a couple months, and then roll it out more broadly. And like menu innovation is just a thing now. You just have to innovate the menu. So Chipotle hasn't had to do it for a very long time, I met with Cava today. They're talking about doing four different menu innovations per year. So I just think that's part of what the expectation is for the consumer of the time.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:48:29] Or a bike.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:48:30] That's it.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:48:31] Basically, that's basically...  

 

Speaker 1 [00:48:35] So the view is the LTOs tend to last 60 days, and Chipotle was sweating them for six months. And so the view was like, hey dude, we can't be sweating these for six month. Maybe we run it for 90 days at a time. Which is why they're thinking three is the right cadence for them versus two, which is what they used to do. And then by the way, the pricing lever is very real, right? They're still exceptionally well priced. It tends to be, I'm gonna get these numbers slightly wrong, but it's like 30% below the better for you category. So the push means in the Cabas of the world and 20% below, the Moe's and Kidoba's of the room. So it's still very much sort of a value offering, catering to average household income of 100,000. Um, what else was there in Joseph? So that to go with that point though.  

 

Speaker 9 [00:49:32] The higher promotion from QSRs and otherwise which creates a larger gap.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:49:39] I think it's a different occasion. Like even if you look at Tato Bell, and this is not my opinion, but they don't raise price on value. Like their whole thing is we raise price on inflation. When our costs go up and raise price accordingly, we're not trying to increase it based off of the value that we can set for value.  

 

Speaker 2 [00:50:02] What did you feel about the category in general?  

 

Speaker 1 [00:50:04] Like a fast casual or like yeah um okay i don't love it  

 

Speaker 5 [00:50:13] Okay.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:50:14] I'm not like super hot on restaurants probably, I'm not super hot consumer probably. And like I do think the low income kind of struggles right now, the high income's fine until the stock market does whatever downward trend it might do. Is there a trade down in this type of business? They benefit from trade down. At like 12 bucks outside of New York, they're actually a beneficiary. Trade activists, no. Cocoa activists. I'll box that back in New York real quick.  

 

Speaker 4 [00:50:43] Like you get a lunch for 12 bucks outside of New York.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:50:48] No, even in LA, it's like a chicken whole, no sides, maybe like $1.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:50:55] Because everybody in L.A. Is all exempt if no one's eating.  

 

Speaker 10 [00:50:59] Right now  

 

Speaker 1 [00:51:06] What are you gonna pitch?  

 

Speaker 5 [00:51:12] Alright, cool, I'll go.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:51:17] Let's just back up for a sec. Wait, is this like in video or no?  

 

Speaker 6 [00:51:21] Like NVIDIA? NVIDia is not tougher for us. We think it's a very good... I think there are very few people smarter than Chet Mabong in general. He's a triplet, incredibly strategic. On what you see right now, NVIDIAS is tough. You have to expect they're going to do a lot in either building data sensors or building software or their foundational spatial models are going to take over the world. To make it all work because software that depicts hardware innovation, especially for the type of very complicated hardware they have, is very tough, particularly when you think about the brilliance that went to the Blackwell. Blackwell is 5, 8, 12 times better than the dead hardware. And Rubin and Feynman are going to be minor improvements on the back of that. That net, it's not clear to me that we... I deeply believe that the black girl may be the most important thing that's happened in human history in the past, like, hundreds. Right? So, um, it's an incredibly incredible innovation. It's an incredible innovation, and it will be valuable to many, like... There's going to be plenty of people that have moved on to Ruben and Simon, but they're going to be small parts of the world that just get black girls, and years from now, are able to know that. It's incredibly powerful.  

 

Speaker 10 [00:52:47] The same way the car was, the same way that the truck was.  

 

Speaker 5 [00:52:52] So, again, I know it sounds like...  

 

Speaker 10 [00:52:55] Thank you very much.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:52:57] But I want to back up for a moment.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:52:59] I am going to have to leave. I'd love to stay in touch with all of you, and if you guys are still out... Let's go. I just don't want to interrupt.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:53:15] I want to back up from them. What does it take to be a hyperscaler? Generally you've created a monopoly in a particular sector and then you've built out hard infrastructure that generally nobody really knows about. So by monopoly I mean Microsoft in operating systems, Amazon in internet retail, Apple in iPhone, and more of them. In social media. You build out that software element and then you build out the data center infrastructure that is absolutely critical. And what you have here is something slightly different where you have, where we build, and by the way, if you could take, go back to all of those innovations where they created, when the UR at Mopinopoli ran very quickly, their ability over their second best was very small. Just came at a critical time, we were able to get ahead of everything very quickly. So, fast forward to, uh, to Hori. Hori has a dramatically better ability to get very large-scale, paralyzed workers with very advanced chips, uh up and running, dramatically better than anybody else, including the hyperscalers. Hyperscalers cannot get to a third. No, no, because it gets two-thirds of what these guys can do on large parallelized networks. So that is why they are being hired by code to implement their operations. What that has done is it has meant that anytime Nvidia is launching a new chip or launching a They give it to CoreWheels first, CoreWheeels shows them how to make it on a large scale. They debug the content system. And it's not the end-of-the-mill chip that's involved. It's the networking involved, and then getting the core to work across everything. It's multiple innovations, all within a head. That gives them a 12-month advance over everybody else, which is why a lot of the Irish government is running to them to help when they're very far behind. A lot of other products on their chips. And basically, they've got chips sitting around that they can't get running at the efficiency that they want. So is that objectively true? Read the Semi-Analysis report on this. It's incredibly, and better yet, hire Dylan Patel and Doug Frankel from Semi Analysis. So talk to you about it. They talk to every single one of the hyperchips. And they went through their tech stack on their parallelized AI deployment, and they're behind on all of it. Each one of them, they gave dreams of notes on how to improve it. Google, Microsoft, all of them came back and just bought it.  

 

Speaker 1 [00:56:17] Like Microsoft or any of these replicates.  

 

Speaker 6 [00:56:21] As of right now, it's been absolutely impossible. They can't build it. So I go to a lot of, for this type of like, this landscape is evolving so much. I had this weird theory that the people that are gonna be able to tell me the most about are the absolute bottom of the barrel suppliers. So I went to a couple of conferences where I just talked to those guys and gals. I talked to one liquid to chip supplier. He said that there was a Microsoft facility where they were asked to come in because Microsoft completely screwed up the pooling for the infrastructure and they needed these guys to just try and fix it to get it to half of what they wanted it to be. That's the level of like problems they're running into. By the way, part of that problem is coming from a fixable... The fixable issue is that the hyper scalers are trying to build their parallelized workloads on top of serialized cloud workloads. When you try and build something, so serialized workloads like cloud infrastructure are what are called fault tolerance. They're meant to come down in nodes, no big deal, that's how they work. When you go to parallelized artificial intelligence workloads, they're fault intolerant. If you try and... When you try and let one of them down, it essentially means the entire thing goes down. So what they've done is they've tried to build their artificial intelligence infrastructure on top of their cloud infrastructure, in part because they have an innovator's dilemma, right? If they start giving up their cloud business to artificial intelligence, it hurts the cloud business. That, theoretically, is fixable, but it's going to take a long time to fix it. And you have a problem where you have this innovator that is now multiple generations ahead, that now has an incredibly strong software stack, and that most importantly is collecting data. The only advantage those other monopolies have for this tiny head start they have was that they got the data faster during the time they had a massive monopoly over others and were able to use that data to get themselves incrementally better off and keep other people in the dark. The entire Google antitrust case that was happening in D.C. Was all about how the incremental things Google did gave them a data advantage that was marginal in the first time, that allowed nobody to catch up. That's what all of these guys have done. And these guys, then, have a much larger data advantage, in part because the data is getting created much faster. I found it! See ya! Yes, sir. Artificial intelligence, great time to talk about that. So we think it's sweet. Thank you for you. Thank you. No, no, no. So I think that is very important. The other thing that's very important is they're building out their data infrastructure in a very AI-friendly way, by which I mean that it's large megawatts near city centers. Low latency, which means that when the robots are talking to each other, they will be able to talk to each others very quickly, so that the advantage will get even better. So we think this could be, this will be a hyper scalar hyper scalar, could be a trillion dollar EV at some point in time. couple of years, and we think that the infrastructure they're building would be very hard to test. And there's one other element that's very, very interesting. If you, this is the first artificial intelligence pure-play mega cap that's existed, and everybody's like, oh the unlock, the unlock the unlock. Very interesting. Every tech mutual fund in ECF is going to have to own a chunk of this come September. They were all chomping at the bit to get it. They really wanted allocations. And it's going to revolt. That is a really rocky idea. There's going be a lot of buying on the back of the Hull and Ops. All of these guys need eggs. There is no such thing as an artificially intelligent mega-cap pure play. Every single one of these tech products is going to be an allocation. That's going more than enough to sustain them.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:01:05] Yeah, it's like Applovin'. Everybody was forced to buy Apploavin'.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:01:10] I mean, to be fair, then Avalon became a fraud, uh, but... Yes, and that's one of the worst...  

 

Speaker 4 [01:01:15] Now he's back, I have no idea what's going on. I want to do this again on the Aflobin message discussion. Oh yeah, I do too.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:01:23] I spoke to someone yesterday that's super bullish and likes it and has been buying it.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:01:30] Sorry, that was not meant to be derogatory. I don't know much about it. My name is Sumo.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:01:42] I'm like, what is there, like, tea, chicken sauce, is there a couple years ahead from an iterative perspective in terms of...  

 

Speaker 6 [01:01:50] A couple of years ahead on building parallelized workloads at scale. Parallel. Yeah, the parallelism is really important. So like when you... When you set up... Parallels processing. Yes, exactly. And that was very unique to, weirdly enough, setting up GQ for Ethereum mining. And they had a weird head start on that, that gave them a head start on networking with GQ. And there's a little bit of a log function that comes with it. The larger you get, the harder it is to do. And so they've just been doing it at scale, dramatically, so like, oracle, way behind.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:02:30] It's exactly now just what Charidad has not capitalized on. Again, huge volumes, parallel processing, GPU. He's a giant.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:02:45] I agree, because when you were talking about it, I had a death.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:02:47] Oh, nice.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:02:48] It's the same concept, it's the analogy. But that's where the first big advances came from, but then there were these tiny little advances that kept happening. When we moved from liquid to chip, they were the first to get that up to scale. They just saw it coming, knew it was happening, because it was already a conversation, we're coming up in a theory of mining, and so they were already ahead on how to do that. Clearly enough, the plumbing from Lisa's ship is really difficult. Microsoft hasn't done it. The only time they've done it, it went totally down. It is remarkably, and so they've got these like, they keep having these marginal advantages. Every time they have a marginal advantage, they, NVIDIA trusts them sooner. The people that are doing liquid chip, the chip tech, they talk to them first. And so it just means they're ahead on everybody else. Then they help Microsoft do it, they help Meta do it. They help my Google do it and it'll just, and God forbid, we haven't even talked about it. And the other thing that I just...  

 

Speaker 5 [01:03:48] Oh, cute.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:03:50] Over-focus on this. Every enterprise hates the way that the hyperscalers try to lock them in. And the fact that this is an option where they're not trying to lock them in, they're giving them the bare metal. Now keep in mind, in the cloud infrastructure, giving you the bare-metal wouldn't have created enough of a margin. But in parallelized workers, it's so hard to do that you still have to pay these guys a lot of money and for their software to make parallelized workers work. So they're still getting paid shits on it, but they're not giving them the feel of having their data lost. It's a practical matter. The data stays there, but it doesn't mean that Gold is mining it in the way that he does.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:04:35] It was interesting because, I mean, pre-IPO, like, it was a consensus short.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:04:41] I will say this.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:04:42] And I will say.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:04:44] Longer than that.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:04:46] There are plenty of people that want to get short of it. I'm not denying that. Listen, the interesting thing about that week, there were so many weird reports from nobody. That had, like, comp- that were literally, uh, spouting totally in- accurate things about the company. I need to come in fairly well at that point. I could have written them pretty good, but these are the two songs. They were just finding these really incorrect things. We would talk to them and be like, wait, this doesn't match with what this is. We'd show them. Nobody wanted to hear it. I genuinely feel like someone was trying to take that. I swear to God. In Who's on Twitter? What are you guys doing? I'm not going to get out of anything. And again, I'm pseudo, but I thought, I swear to God, there was, I feel like there was some type of, I thought it was a really good way to, if you could have attacked this IPO in full though, it would have really hurt the long-term cost of capital for artificial intelligence in the United States, which I think would have been very good if you were somebody foreign that wanted something that was our cost of capitol, because we were so far ahead. And that really put it between deep-sea, which was total bullshit.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:06:08] We were, we knew about DPC, the way they published it. DPC capabilities are nowhere near what it is. But that was the same timing, right?  

 

Speaker 6 [01:06:16] It was right in that same mall.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:06:20] Because the catback cycle is slower than that.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:06:22] On the core LLM improvement, which is nothing important.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:06:28] But it wasn't the actual cost allocation for it was not. Exactly  

 

Speaker 6 [01:06:37] But they hit the market with all of it. They hit the markets with it. By the way, the company that made Deep Sea, owned by a hedge fund that was short the US market, going into...  

 

Speaker 2 [01:06:48] PC.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:06:50] What's that? Genius! In a big way, in a big, big way. Made a ton of money? Props to them! It's a big fun, too. Yeah!  

 

Speaker 3 [01:07:02] It took ten billion dollars, is that right? They're probably a lot bigger after that. Well, they were eight before that. Now they're ten plus.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:07:12] But yeah, how we do it. Yeah, right. So many bad guys. This is probably going to be an idea, and then we'll go back. I think you had something else spicy to talk about. What else was spicy, though? Something else that was not. That was, that was...  

 

Speaker 3 [01:07:25] That was, that was spicier than coreweed?  

 

Speaker 4 [01:07:28] What did he want from me? What could this mean? Yeah, I don't know. I'm saying that you said you had... It's a hot tamale. That was his question. What do you think is going, by the way?  

 

Speaker 6 [01:07:42] Um, where do I, where I think the stock is at? I think we're well through 200, end of the year, early Q1 next year, and I think we've got room to run from there. And I will say this, like I'm very much, if it takes a year for me to get where I want to go, I'm okay with that, like this, we have... I know there's volatility in this. I'm just happy for the volatility of the US. Well aware of the small float and fault issues around that, but fundamental infrastructure that exists is expected. It takes a little time, there are depths, but that may happen. You gotta be ready to...  

 

Speaker 4 [01:08:29] You're ready to stomach it. Before you move on, where's more scientific going? Before I go, it's hotter. More scientific should be out.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:08:43] Alright, I'm going to offer a menu of options, you guys can vote, um, I don't know if, have we, is there a new-  

 

Speaker 4 [01:08:53] Not really. I mean, yes, I've said that we're going to capture some activist ideas. I don't want anything, you know, we don't, obviously don't know anything that you haven't discussed publicly already, but that activist thing, because I think that would be amazing to get.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:09:13] Okay, so the menu just shortened a little bit.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:09:17] By the way, I do have a good actress idea for you at some point. Do you do biome at all? No. Okay, nevermind. That was the fastest no wife ever had.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:09:29] Uh...  

 

Speaker 6 [01:09:31] Because we're about to, we're thinking of going out today, so we'll be there. I'm not gonna tell you.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:09:36] All right, that's fine. Okay, here's the menu. Global Star, Lionsgate.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:09:46] I'm sorry, I-I-I... That was what my, my, where y'all...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:09:50] What's your vote?  

 

Speaker 2 [01:09:52] Uhhh... I have a history with Globostar, but I should say Lionsgate, but Globastar is...  

 

Speaker 5 [01:10:02] That's real, okay. Let's read it. There we go.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:10:09] We're going to get coffee, some dessert, I'll listen to anyone.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:10:19] I'll do, I'll...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:10:23] I'll do Lionsgate because I presented it at the Woolfactism conference yesterday. Were you there or no?  

 

Speaker 3 [01:10:33] I had an earnings call that morning, so I missed your presentation because you went first. And I was there as the day went on. And our guy, Galax Wolf, was there and he heard the pitch and tried to get me. He thought it was shit. No, no, I think he likes it. I think that he likes him too. Okay.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:10:53] All right, we'll go there. And then we can talk to Matt if we have time. So Lionsgate historically hasn't really worked well for shareholders. So you go back in history, this thing was a rocket ship. Okay, sorry. This is a movie and TV studio. When we think about what is the business model of a studio, it's basically kind of like a pharma company, where you have the production side, where it costs money to make content. Not that profitable, kind of volatile, but that content that you make over the course of decades, then... Gets collected into an IP library. That IP library is 20,000 titles that Lionsgate has, John Wick, Hunger Games, Now You See Me, Twilight, like a lot of great franchises. That they monetize by under long-term recurring revenue licensing contracts at a very high margin. So basically, the library IP licensing accounts for 30% of revenue, but 80 to 90% of profits.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:12:04] There will be a revenue increase in making profit out of this.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:12:07] Yes, and it has the libraries, you know, close to a billion dollars in revenue, but it's, you know 40 plus percent margins versus the production size, just kind of like all over the place, but you know it's just doing what it does to keep the libraries growing. So historically the company was just a studio, did really well, stock did super well. They had buy-out offers, which didn't pan out, which we can get into, but at one point in 2016, they acquired a cable network at a small streaming business called Stars. Okay, they bought this thing for $4.4 billion in 2016 and all of a sudden, people started cord cutting and going to digital and then this was a really disastrous acquisition that they did. And the stock has just been tanking since. And then at some point in 2021, they, um... Called it quits on the vertically integrated strategy, said we're gonna separate back out into two distinct publicly traded companies. The process started in 2022, it's taken three years to get that done. It had just finished a month ago. So now you have two distinct publicly traded company, one in particular is Ryan, which is Justice Studio's business, the other one is Starz, SDRZ. Studio and vibra. Correct, yeah. And so, one of the biggest changes that happened with the split is not just you have two separate companies with their own focus, management teams, strategic optionality, but the governance has been massively improved. The parent company, when these two things were together, was a dual class share structure in which the largest shareholder had 24% voting power. So when I mentioned in the past they had take-out offers, Hasbro wanted to buy them for 40 bucks. Apparently this individual wanted $40.50. Take the deal. The stock is seven bucks today, okay? They also had an opportunity to sell stars at a profit at CVS. Didn't happen. So now. He never stops, he holds his altis hostage. That's his smile. He's been in this thing since 2009.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:14:33] Right here, right here.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:14:35] Um, still anonymous though. He's just not a seller. He's not a seller. Everybody hates him. Everybody on Wall Street hates him. The board hates him, the management team hates him... Literally everybody fucking hates him!  

 

Speaker 2 [01:14:52] Carlson's a TDS, you know?  

 

Speaker 3 [01:14:55] Oh, who is he? Okay. I know you. He's got a you-know-carlson, yes. I know, you-knew-like-that. So that makes sense. You can tell us.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:15:02] What's collapsing is voting power goes from 24% down to 13%, which means a shareholder that is interested in exercising their shareholder rights to influence the company now has a path available to them.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:15:16] Yeah, that's not too much to talk about.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:15:20] Not too much. When everybody hates them.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:15:24] He is a chairman, right?  

 

Speaker 7 [01:15:26] He was the chairman of the chairman's theory company, he's on the board of both, but the lion stood the new entity has yet to name a chairman. Can you send to me at the board level of where this is going? Okay, so basically, you have this business, oh yeah, and then on top of that, how does a business perform? Well, last year was terrible. So they had a massive flop called Borderlands, and traditionally, they lost a lot of money. Traditionally, they run a pretty de-risked model where they pre-sell the international rights to their films. They de-wrist the financial model. There's not much upside, but they rarely lose money, and they generally-  

 

Speaker 3 [01:16:07] and they generally produce 23% IRRs on the film.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:16:09] Or something else. Like, it's actually... Really well run in that regard, and their, you know, org structure's actually also quite efficient. This was a rare occasion where they had a big flop with the leftover COVID and the strikes and this and that, so that really hit profits down to 300 million in EBITDA less this past year. And then the flow through to the library is also, you know not gonna be there too. So there's not, there's guiding to base, they're not officially guiding, but the street has it as basically flat EBITDA growth year over year to this fiscal year. What they were supposed to do last year, if they had no losses, was 400 million in EBITDA. And so with the new slate and no losses right now, potentially you should see a path easily towards 350 to 400 million EBITTA. You get back to about the 400 million EBITDA with a low to mid-teens EBIT DA multiple. This is at least a double the stock. And so you have this pretty terrible history and a lot of negative sentiment and a lot of people who didn't just buy it because of all the technical governance barriers that's now been basically fully reset and and very clean going forward. And so I think it's a super very interesting setup. I think this continues to be strategic. Supposedly strategic interests in the company and that you know if you look at the management team and how they talk about it They seem like they're sellers in the next 12 months of the business That be better than the double or not could be if there's a bidding war which they're very well could be I mean You look at a precedent M&A multiples in studios way higher than the loaded mid-teens even don't multiply decided like Amazon bought MGM like It's like 20-something times even time. Um, you know, I don't know, I'm not underwriting to-  

 

Speaker 4 [01:18:05] that, but 3 to 400 million is that  

 

Speaker 7 [01:18:09] 400 million. If you did 20 times, you could get 400 million, then this is like quadruple.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:18:15] What's with the borderlands thing you said, was the borderland left over from the strike?  

 

Speaker 7 [01:18:22] From COVID and the strike, so it's like a video game movie.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:18:25] Yeah, yeah, yeah. But was it delayed over and over again? Yeah, it was delayed, causing a... So I'm intrigued because Take-Two is going to release a new Borderlands... ...Imminently, like in the next couple of weeks. So, to your point, like, I'm curious and I'm sure it's a man. On the back half, right, because like if they were delayed from the video game release the first time.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:18:51] Do you have any shorts and mats? Do you know any shorts or mats?  

 

Speaker 6 [01:18:56] Bye! Nobody that's really...  

 

Speaker 5 [01:19:01] It could have been some library sales.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:19:03] I think that's a good point.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:19:07] I never did. Jason has been... My understanding is that this is also just a bad movie. That's kind of what I like. I haven't seen...  

 

Speaker 4 [01:19:17] I mean, whatever, I don't know, I'm afraid of the fucking press. Yeah, I'd be glad if the press did not like that about me.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:19:24] I mean, yeah, he brought that press, yeah  

 

Speaker 7 [01:19:27] Yeah, yeah, so that's that's the question dirty on Lionsgate  

 

Speaker 3 [01:19:33] I've known it for many years, you know.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:19:36] Very underpublished by the BICED community.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:19:44] I was going to say my younger son works for Joe now, before he... Where Joe and Topper, he worked at a firm called Gem Films, and Gem Filmes is a division of a large money management company that a good friend of mine owns, and that guy grew up in Bel Air with the two founders of Lionsgate, so Gem Filmos only does documentaries. And my friend funds those documentaries out of his own pocket in conjunction with one of the two founders from Lionsgate. They do that on the side. They do it outside of Lionsgate, so my son has done that.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:20:33] Yeah, that's not, because I know that absolutely.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:20:36] There is no real library value to documentaries unless you've got something like the Al Gore, you know. And that's not what they're doing. I actually disagree.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:20:48] So I think that could be written in, we've actually, so my wife works in media technology and one of the things she does is requires, basically for free, iQIYI that is kind of across the globe and then gives licensing fees and kicks it back to the outcomes. So it costs her nothing. There is so much demand for documentary.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:21:11] Historical footage.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:21:13] Like it's crazy I don't know. Any type of high-quality entertainment that isn't just COVID is really fascinating. The whole rise of FAST has fueled all this interest in like, you can now divide up the types of stuff you're interested in in a slightly longer form, like documentary, western, and stuff. And it's all like getting rewrote, like uh, we should talk about that.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:21:39] There's also a pretty big AI angle here that nobody really talks about, which is AI is going to revolutionize, or be a pretty massive technological leap forward to the studio business. Pre-production, post-production and library optimization, marketing efficiency, AI can help with all of that stuff. You know, on a tentpole movie as a Bain consulting study, you can save 5 to 20% of time and cost. We're talking tens of millions of dollars. You know, the vice chair of Lionsgate, one of the co-founders, Michael Burns, he was in a New York magazine article interview yesterday. We were thinking about this movie where the scene of 10,000 soldiers in a mountain in Tibet, we could have done it, it would have cost us a few million bucks, we just recreated it for $10,000.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:22:33] AI is never going to be able to make movies from scratch, but it sees individual bits of it, of the VFX, the post-production, the editing sound, oh my god, that's incredibly time-consuming. I will tell you though that the number of these...  

 

Speaker 3 [01:22:55] The number of these productions then will explode, because the rule is you set your budget for a documentary at $700,000. At $700 thousand dollars if the subject matter is relatively adaptable to a lot of different markets, you'll be profitable. $750, $800,000, you're losing money. So that's your budget, but if you can stretch your budget by 30 or 40% by utilizing AI, it's unbelievable how much you have.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:23:36] And a half, you cut that in half, all of a sudden, I thought you were going to do something. Now, the one wrinkle there, I do think, is that everybody knows that, which means you have an actual explosion of content. That's what I'm saying. That actually, that's the negative side. Sure, you bring your cost down by 50%, but you increase your marketing cost by 800%.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:23:55] I do think the scale advantage of the major studios though is really important. Distribution, the IT they already own that they can recycle. I mean literally in that interview he's like, yeah we have a rated R movie, I can sell the AI model, make me a PG-13 version of this. And I'll have it in three hours.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:24:12] He's really smart, that guy, he's really, both those co-founders are really right. I think Mark, being there, messed up a lot of that.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:24:24] I have a double espresso, do you want a coffee or anything? Are you happy to serve, or are you a tear?  

 

Speaker 9 [01:24:42] It's great and all, but we're not in a way that anyone can just take it and get what you want. So I think there's a dynamic for the studios that know how to make movies. And have the talent to utilize it. We're not at the point where you can get a rental.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:25:03] We all have a console, we all have computers. None of us are writing novels, right?  

 

Speaker 5 [01:25:10] I think that's where the value of that is going to be.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:25:13] If you have skills, you can acquire that talent, you could use that to get a relationship. So that's where I think the big guys are still going to win.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:25:20] I think that Merck would block a sale, right, but I mean going forward, he just doesn't have enough because it collapses the Jewish airspace.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:25:33] Okay. And he, does he have the alliance on the board, the alliance date?  

 

Speaker 7 [01:25:38] Or is it just his single home, which is his employee, but like, how big is the board? So he's got two, uh, two of them.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:25:49] Okay, he's right you have other large shareholders in there too  

 

Speaker 7 [01:25:56] Steve Mitchin, who's been in the movie business in the past, has been buying up this stock like a motherfucker, so he is now at 12.6% ownership.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:26:05] To match, uh, uh... That's just good.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:26:10] They put a poison pill in at 15% because they're worried about a creeping tender from these guys. He's got all this, like, Middle Eastern money backing him, and the word is that he... Holy shit. The word is is that, he wants to, uh...  

 

Speaker 5 [01:26:23] Oh, that sucks.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:26:30] The word is that he wants to buy the company. Mnuchin wants to by line.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:26:38] The tape is on the board as well, I'm not kidding.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:26:40] He has no words. 13, 12.5%, he's coming pretty close, I'm sure. He's going to, yeah, he's going.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:26:46] That's why they did the 15% which actually technically is not allowed under Canadian law and Anyways, is that where it says that companies incorporated in BC. Yeah, but operational headquarters is 20 minutes from where I live  

 

Speaker 3 [01:27:01] Why the domicile layer, just based on...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:27:04] Historical that's where he was originally founded  

 

Speaker 3 [01:27:08] were difficult to affect, say, a proxy fight if, for example, Mark tried to block an acceptable takeover and you thought, OK, I'm just going to litigate this.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:27:19] Your older rights are better in Canada versus the U.S. And I just finished my first and very successful Canadian activist campaign. My firm is actually Canadian, although I'm based in L.A.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:27:33] I think I knew that. Yeah, so... What was their name?  

 

Speaker 7 [01:27:37] Internet? It's a Canadian apartment, Rick. Yeah, it just got sold.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:27:42] Congratulations.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:27:44] It's what she's in Canada, I just show up, and they're like, oh fuck. Uh, yeah. So look, I think it's very interesting is that there's like four ways. There's a technology way, there's an earnings way because they're laughing a shitty year, there's a regulatory way because media M&A should ideally be easier now, and there's a, um, and, uh, there is a... Want to type on that?  

 

Speaker 4 [01:28:11] I asked if you sent me the M&A, I thought you were talking about that. Oh no, it was Wednesday. Oh, sorry.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:28:19] Yeah, and then there's a governance or structural way to stop.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:28:24] What's the, what's the average capitalization? 2 billion. 2 billion, okay. EV 3.6? It's pretty easy to digest.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:28:33] Yeah, it sounds like there's a scare she's got. Valerie next to him. It's coming out this Friday. The premiere was on Tuesday night. And they invited me to the premiere and the after party with the stars. And I'm like, sorry, I gotta go to an activist conference in New York to pitch your stuff. They're like, fucking A, man.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:28:52] I made the wrong decision.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:28:53] Yeah, I couldn't do both. I looked into it. Who's the check, right? It's Anadarmus. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I'm happy to go. I mean, yeah, you want to hear match or  

 

Speaker 6 [01:29:10] You wanna talk about that?  

 

Speaker 4 [01:29:13] Well, it's at the right level if it's not breaking down further.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:29:18] If you were talking, Joe, you said just the short story, so the short story is articulated by Jason Ater from Spring Owl once. Oh, a match? A match. Which just, he believes that the fake quality of dating sites, right? Where people... He said more and more people are using avatars, right? And the avatar itself is even one step removed from the human being. And so while it appears as if there's a pheromone, and I'm sort of going off his pitch from last November that I listened to, to the degree that more and more the. The population on these sites are, quote unquote, bots or avatars that are not realistic people. People are hiding behind those bots or avatarrs, you're seeing less engagement. People really want more of a touch and feel. They want to see the person. They want know that the person's not telling them that they're a partner at Goldman Sachs when they're working at Chipotle. And people lie on these sites. But the more that it's going towards... Nobody wants to see a bold impression.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:30:42] Oh my god, give me the trolley I hear they have great growth, eight percent. Three meal a day. Twenty percent earnings. That's why I want to go on a date.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:30:52] So it's just that he sees that the engagement is actually going to decrease rather than increase due to the proliferation of AI. So he felt like these business models were actually declining in value.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:31:09] Send the guy with the 26 year old girlfriend down online. I know, I know. I know.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:31:15] Does that happen?  

 

Speaker 3 [01:31:21] I see a couple of tables  

 

Speaker 5 [01:31:23] Yes, I know, yeah.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:31:26] There appears to be a bit of a mismatch.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:31:33] I remember going here with my girlfriend at the time, and I remember being like, everyone's here with the pot. What is going on here? I remember just Daniel. And I remember looking at this one tableau and I was like, God, this is crazy. Thank you. This guy must have been in like, early 30s, like, in like a really nice piece, like wha- why?  

 

Speaker 5 [01:32:04] What the f**k is happening?  

 

Speaker 4 [01:32:08] I could do your homework, like...  

 

Speaker 6 [01:32:12] The question I have on this... It doesn't see, I mean, to be fair. And I'm just parroting that short piece. I'm not sure if the stock never shorted it. My main question is the AI cut the other way. Matt has made major investments in artificial intelligence. I don't know, that's the bull case. He was just articulating the contract case. But doesn't the artificial intelligence let them get rid of the box?  

 

Speaker 7 [01:32:41] There's a lot of authentication, safety, and trust features being implemented, mandatory face photos, things like that, actually, yeah, so, um, okay, so basically... The sentiment today is online dating is dead, Gen Z doesn't want to date, doesn't care about meeting people, blah, blah blah, because the metrics at Tinder look like shit, so that's what, that must be what's happening, okay? Here's the real history. The history is that during COVID, they had a big boom with all these users that came in. The problem is that a lot of those users were big profiles, low quality users, whatever you want to call them, you know, bad actors, and Oh wow. And then when COVID ended, you basically ended up with an app, a product that had not been updated for a decade. You had a shitty ecosystem of low quality or fake profiles. And people not using it as much because you're exiting COVID and that's just what it was, right?  

 

Speaker 8 [01:33:45] So this is a little programming with chocolate, coconut meringue, chocolate cake on the side, and hazelnut. So torta de martillo, almond polenta cake, panamontata mixed berries sorbet, tapon bologna and chocolate sauce and passion fruit.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:34:06] We gotta go with the pop-aloney.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:34:10] So, they're coming out of COVID, user metrics are declining, you also have an effort now to get rid of the fake accounts, that also hits your user metrics, the CEO they hired decided to raise pricing for whatever reason, it also hits user metrics and then your product hasn't been updated, so people are just like... Wow, this is like really not that interesting. So you had like a lot of, oh yeah, and on top of that, the CEO during COVID went out and bought a non-dating company for $1.8 billion, which is not worth anywhere near as much. Came with two apps, one's been shut down since, the other one I'm telling them to sell. Wow. So like total disaster, CEO change, inconsistent leadership, and a board that is utterly and completely incompetent. Um, so this has been an operational disaster. We work within their portfolio. This company owns half the market. They own 47 different apps. Okay, the only two major ones they don't own are Bumble and Grindr. But everything else is theirs. Tinder, Hinge, all the way down. Hinge has been led by the same founder for the past decade. The product is excellent and it's growing 25% year over year. People love it, people pay for it, people want a product that works. It's not that online gaming is dead, it's just that the products suck. And so, I laid out a, I don't know how much of this we can. So, I basically laid out this entire corporate strategy for them a year ago, where you need to adopt a portfolio based approach, where each of these apps is basically the same app, but targeting a different demo. So we should consolidate the backend infrastructure because they're basically the space of the same software. Consolidate the back end infrastructure, you can also optimize your marketing spend by app and then also enable more efficient cross-selling between the apps because most people that use online dating apps use multiple at the same time. So if you're on Tinder and you're Asian-American, maybe you say, hey, try our app called Music! Or if you're Hispanic, try Chispa, et cetera, right? So there's a lot of cross-selling opportunity you could do at zero cap to extend your LTV. And it could be a massive profit windfall. So now, one year after engaging with them, and it also had to go public and run a proxy fight against these idiots. We got two new people on the board. We got rid of a legacy director. We've got the board declassified. So now they'll all be up for election within a couple years. And we have an information sharing agreement between my firm and the company. We don't have any MNDI right now, but we can go under the hood from time to time under that agreement. So the new CEO, Spencer Raskoff, is the co-founder of Zillow and former CEO. He actually knows the fuck he's doing, okay?  

 

Speaker 4 [01:37:12] From C.E.O. Of Kindert? No, Zillow. Zillows.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:37:17] Yeah, we actually just blew out the CEO of Tigger. He's going to take direct control of that. So basically, there's a few initiatives underway. One, infrastructure consolidation. That should be $70 to $100 million of savings. It's a $1.2 billion EBITDA company. It's highly profitable, highly cash-inheritive. 100% of free cash is going towards buybacks. They're doing the infrastructure consolidation We did a 13% RIF, so headcount, reduce, reduce fans and layers, re-org Tinder and many other apps. Made it more of a portfolio-based approach. And then, on top of that, there's another, under my estimate, another $100 to $200 million of OpEx optimization to happen, CloudSend, General GNA, marketing optimization, things like that. I've actually even, like they brought in Bain Consulting, but I'm helping them with other consultants to come in and finish all this off. So he's executing on the corporate strategy that I laid out a while ago. He's there now moving really fast because he knows he's on the clock. And they left the profit guidance unchanged. Just by announcing the $100 million savings from the headcount reduction and then all this other stuff they're doing, profit guidance is unchanged, okay? So we just created a one to $300 million budget to reinvest in growth and products. And if we can bend the curve on the users and Tinder, which has been stabilizing lately, you get a top-line inflection on a much more optimized cost structure. Your free cash flow per share, because of the buybacks, is going to be way above people's estimates. And the re-rating of the multiple applied to that could lead to a double, if not a triple of stock price. So it's $7.5 billion in our market cap today, so you have liquidity too. And it doesn't happen, I'm coming back, I mean, somebody might put pressure on them next year.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:39:16] Somebody  

 

Speaker 7 [01:39:20] I think Elliot's out. Starboard is still there, but...  

 

Speaker 4 [01:39:24] Oh, it's out? I think so. That's too unfortunate, man.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:39:28] Stuff like that. Starboard is still there, and then I'm there, I own half a percent and I got all this shit done, so. One of my, one of my co-  

 

Speaker 5 [01:39:41] Yes, I'll follow  

 

Speaker 8 [01:39:44] That was really good.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:39:46] Bye bye.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:39:49] I don't have time to give it up, I'm over it.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:39:51] That's insane. That is insane. Something that's so dumb. And also, by the way, has a lot of data. I have a friend who works in strategy over there. It is interesting because one of the things he reminds me of is that all the data they have, the one piece of data they don't have, is when it actually ends well. They, like, they have all these thoughts about people being indicated. They can tell you all the dirty chats people send to each other, but whether or not they actually see people end up together is the thing they just don't care about. Together at all, together whether it's tonight or one time. He's actually working on an AI project.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:40:46] So AI is a big element here too, with onboarding, matching algorithm, post-match experience with the messaging, and even like location-based features that I've recommended to help discover date locations and optimize timing and scheduling and all that stuff. So yeah, onboarding, the biggest impediment to people actually finishing the onboarding process is picking out their pictures for their profile. It's actually a very intimidating thing for a lot of people, and they have a feature called the AI Photo Selector. You get a temporary local access to your photo album. They'll scan the whole thing.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:41:20] We're going with something!  

 

Speaker 7 [01:41:22] Yeah, you'll scan the whole thing, pick up the five best pictures of you and say use these. These will work better than the other ones.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:41:30] That is smart, it's like a headshot thing, and it's, like, uh, tech, and, like...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:41:35] Like a matching algorithm, AI can massively enhance. And then post-match, you can have an AI assistant like helping you chat or whatever.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:41:44] I have to  

 

Speaker 7 [01:41:45] I have fingers, A-I-D.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:41:47] This is a legitimate photograph, is that right?  

 

Speaker 7 [01:41:50] There's also, there's like video verification now and all this stuff, you can have a verified badge on your thing and if you do, you actually get player swipes and watches. I was never on that.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:42:03] We're like happy about it, but then we're also like...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:42:05] They're launching this AI daily drop, where it's like a super curated single profile just once a day, like this first thing we think can be perfect for you.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:42:18] Thanks for coming back.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:42:20] No, not, not yet. Not yet. That's what the, that's what the budget's for.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:42:26] You're like a hotel tonight, you deli zom-  

 

Speaker 7 [01:42:29] You know what, he came from Zillow, he probably knows about that. The other thing they're launching soon, ahead of back to school season, which is big for Tinder, is double dating. So you can pair your profile with a friend, like Joe and I can be on there, and us two can swipe on some girls or whatever.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:42:50] Hey man, work that so good. Would you like to go on a double date with us?  

 

Speaker 6 [01:42:54] The whole thing was, there was an app called Grouper, that did this, and they were doing this.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:42:58] Yeah, but that's not shocking. But this thing actually lowers the pressure on people. Because it's more of a group thing. That's what Gen Z wants. They want lower pressure, lower friction experiences to meeting people, and then you see what happens. That's just good generally.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:43:12] I will say, major, I think, strategic mistake was not buying, uh, buying fuel when it was a lot shitty. It doesn't bother me. Uh, they just got so ahead of the whole, like, tendency to do all that bullshit. That was, that, that continues.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:43:36] They did buy H.E.R.E., the lesbian game app. What's it called, the H. E. R.E.? Yeah, I mean, the best one is gay men. Like, that's the best iPhone. They have a competing app called Archie.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:43:55] That started by-  

 

Speaker 7 [01:43:56] Yeah, but that hasn't done that well, right? I thought it was incubated within match organically. That hasn't come out well. It hasn't yet, because they haven't invested in it. So they just refreshed the product, and then they're going to launch a marketing campaign this summer. I have a friend who is a big grinder, a shareholder, a...  

 

Speaker 3 [01:44:12] I said to him, are you worried about Archer? He said no, and I can tell you why. And he laid out a couple of different reasons why. But it's a structure.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:44:22] Higher profitability that that gay dating app and so if you can capture some market share  

 

Speaker 3 [01:44:29] The interaction is unbelievable. Some of it is a bit like it's not guaranteed that we'll get it.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:44:37] So, like...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:44:40] So, um, so yeah, I think, you know, they could do a divestiture of that one remaining that's bizarre, that's not bad.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:44:47] I'll file that warrant to buy back.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:44:49] And, you know, with all this investment capacity that they created, you can bend the curve. It's not like, you don't need a lot. You don't have to buy anything. It's simply so negative, valuation is so cheap. It's just, it's honestly very similar to Tulio, where it had a lot of success. It's like, change CEO, upgrade your board, upgrade to founder 30, cost optimization.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:45:10] And when the inflection happens, it's just like, boom. It's locked in the bag.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:45:16] I-I-I think there's this whole, like, changing narrative that they're, like totally getting away from dating. I do think that'll change eventually. So I think it'll be a lot more. That it was in the past. And by the way, you're just a faggot for a second. You guys heard about this recent statistic. Drugs and alcohol among middle schoolers down dramatically.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:45:42] Yeah.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:45:43] Is that a good or bad thing? Obviously, in my view, a bad thing. The reason they're not drinking and doing drugs is because they're not hanging out their crap. I have to believe it.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:46:02] They're hanging out with their friends, they're not hanging out with their friend in a physical location. They're hang out with their friends whether it's like online or somewhere else.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:46:10] That's a good narrative though, people want more IRL experiences on this.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:46:15] That's it I don't disagree.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:46:18] Is this cheap enough for you to look at, or? There's also gotta be like 40 buck a cheep. I really like cheap. It's a good man. A good man likes it.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:46:26] Oh, he was like, I gotta talk to you.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:46:27] He was like, I gotta talk to Rick before I can talk to you, basically. Yeah, he was a little weird. I tried to explain it to you. Rick sent people to events and they could all gather there. Do you ever talk to him? Yeah. He talks to him. I'm happy to... I forgot what he said today. Or a bad thing. I am not the same guy.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:46:50] Right? Like, that's what I think. That's exactly why you have to hook up a lot higher. He's the hedge fund guy that always...  

 

Speaker 9 [01:46:57] And that goes to him with like the sex, drugs, and alcohol.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:47:01] I came back two weeks ago, no really. Yeah, I'm sure you already rented it. But, I always thought I'd have it here.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:47:09] Well, I got that mic, because I think the same thing, so I think...  

 

Speaker 4 [01:47:13] This is a good example, like...  

 

Speaker 7 [01:47:17] Like the past CEO, they've had four CEOs in five years. Totally incomparable. I grew up on the board when I was 75 years old. Why the fuck is he overseeing the turnaround of 10 million? I'm sorry. No offense to these people's names.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:47:34] You're not the market, you're not the market.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:47:40] He's a hard guy, we just know it.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:47:42] Just shut up.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:47:43] The inability to prioritize the things that matter versus the things you don't.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:47:47] Politics and incompetency like that, because you talked about that was like, oh, well, you had had a draft. Yeah, no, I'll be talking about that. You probably just didn't know, you know. In general, about the actual result, all you care about is what the slide looked like, or how the slide looks, and things would get thrown out of being presented, because the slide wouldn't look as good, and everything is about making the slide. Yeah. It was, it was, I just saw it and it was like... I was like, we should really start pulling together a database of really good slides that we've made. And I was, like, this is what you want? So he was probably part of the 13% reduction. I will say, I just think my friend would have told me if he was not. I know he might not have, because he hated this guy so much that he actually moved, I think, underpins actually.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:48:38] Okay, you know the funny thing is like I was trying to see you I spent a lot of time with him now after the process might end there and He was like the head of marketing at tinder and the head and hint marketing a hinge never fucking met Two orders apps in our portfolio. They never spoke to each other  

 

Speaker 6 [01:48:58] We'll just take it.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:48:59] You'd be amazed at how often that happens. Like Estee Lauder, every single brand has its own silo.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:49:11] Yeah  

 

Speaker 3 [01:49:11] Starting from a brand CEO, to a brand CFO, to brand CMO, and they never talk. Do you think they have to have each other?  

 

Speaker 6 [01:49:24] That do they attack each other publicly. Hins put out a full campaign against how much shit Tinder is. Like, literally, and by the way, Tinder at the time, the cash flow app of the business, literally Hins was doing it. It was just like talking, like every subway was covered with stops, so I...  

 

Speaker 5 [01:49:48] Do you remember when we were in the AF?  

 

Speaker 6 [01:49:51] Unwrapped! Oh, I can't believe it!  

 

Speaker 7 [01:49:54] No, it's like it's it's crazy that like me as an outsider can develop all these ideas and strategies for them Like it just goes to show how fucking hard of these people are like if I can do this for them Then like you can come up with better ideas sitting at this table than these people have in the past 10 years  

 

Speaker 6 [01:50:14] Do you want to take each other's taxes?  

 

Speaker 4 [01:50:16] It sounds like our government.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:50:21] Yeah, exactly. It's a governance issue.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:50:37] I put out a web of all their pictures and connected where they all know each other from.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:50:43] That's crazy.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:50:44] And the guy in the middle is the one that is fucking clued in.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:50:50] Cut off the head of that thing.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:50:53] Are you talking about Elf yet? No, not Elf, yet. Short or long? Short. I...  

 

Speaker 3 [01:51:07] I think this acquisition was designed almost solely to cover up the deterioration that we're seeing in the core business. It wishes it.  

 

Speaker 2 [01:51:18] Oh  

 

Speaker 3 [01:51:19] I mean, we had Elf, which was a pretty explosive brand. They bought Naturium, paid a pretty hefty multiple for Naturium. Have done almost nothing with that. So their one prior acquisition experience, very disappointing, much smaller, like low Hundreds.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:51:45] They were tiny at the point.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:51:47] They were small at that point. Now they're taking on $600 million worth of debt, $200 million earn-out, and they're issuing 2.6 million shares of stock, at the same point that they tell us, our stock is so cheap, our stocks are so undervalued, and the issue $260 million worth-of-it to sellers. I mean, either the stock is not really cheap, or the stock just overpriced, and that's why they're handing it off to the sellers of the business. But, I mean, I... You know, I think I told you. I mean, my brother-in-law was the founder of Solvee, fastest growing beverage brand in the United States. At the peak of growth, they sell it to Pepsi for $400 million, and incentives change. I mean when somebody has a couple hundred million dollars in their pocket and $600 million of cash is going to flow into the pockets of the road shareholders. Like to me, two different things happen. One, your life has changed, right? You've been working 24-7 to build a business. Now you've cashed out. You either head for the beach for a year or two, you buy your green house in Aspen or Italy or wherever that is, and you kind of put your feet up and you relax a little bit and say, that was phenomenal, let me take a little time off and assess. Or... You find other opportunities. You're an entrepreneur. Now you have more than enough cash to back a couple of new and unusual entities. I mean, my brother-in-law with his, I'm sure his take was, you know, somewhere in the low couple hundred millions from that transaction. I mean he set up an investment firm and venture backed. 20 companies over the last, you know, 15 or 20 years. Some have been great, some have been dogs, but I mean, that was his focus. It wasn't the business that he sold. And he sold the business to Pepsi, which frankly is one of the easiest companies. To plug the business into. I mean, they own their distribution system. So they were buying a beverage company. All they had to do was put it on the same trucks. They carry Tropicana, orange juice, Pepsi, and all the other beverage products. And they mangled it, and three years later, you couldn't buy a soap. So, Rode, which is a three-year-old company, that they just sold for a billion dollars to Elle. All based on one particular 27-year-old celebrity. She's still getting paid by the company, too, because she's creative. No real infrastructure. It has ten products, ten stews, that they were selling online. Ten stews.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:54:50] Case that holds the lip gloss. Like she came up with a phone case like this that you put your lip gloss on the back of it.  

 

Speaker 4 [01:54:58] That's a good one. What is that one? That's great. I want to know more. We are making $112 million dollars in business. How big is that? That's pretty huge. That's insane. That's huge.  

 

Speaker 9 [01:55:13] I think it was brilliant by her. I'm in the wrong business. I would also point out that Bieber has no money.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:55:22] You're gonna be told it's right  

 

Speaker 9 [01:55:24] years ago so like Bieber's money is like he has no pipeline of money like Justin so like there is a there is dynamic where like a lot of people stood back and said don't sell your rights this young and Bieber has no pipe line he sold for like 200 million and that's all his money and he can't go on stage again he has horrible anxiety he hasn't performed in a while like and I don't think Hailey's making a lot of money so there's also a question of whether She didn't sell the company. What do you mean? Prior to the company leading into this, it's not like she was making a bunch of modeling money or anything else. This was her money.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:56:04] It's just an odd story, because ELF has consistently told us that they have an almost unlimited runway of growth, so if that's the case, why not just grow in a relatively riskless manner internally, rather than make this acquisition at a time when the metrics really head start I mean, look, we get track channel data every two weeks. From Nielsen, Serpana, IRI, and you could see that the business was trailing off. And I think it incorporates massive execution risk to do this. The health management has taken a lot of their share ownership off the table by selling stock. Clearly you have, they're acquiring a company where the insiders are cashing out for the most part. I mean if the stock they get and the earn out turn out to be worthless, they still made six hundred million dollars, which is effectively three times sales. So the deal's a deal for sure.  

 

Speaker 7 [01:57:13] And get the billion dollar headline.  

 

Speaker 5 [01:57:15] Exactly. That's right.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:57:19] And the funniest thing was that Rode, this fall, is going into Sephora. So from a DTC business, they're going into the best beauty retailer there is. I mean, Sephora is head and shoulders above all time. Elf has never been able to get their products into Sephora. So there are some people who thought, well, they're buying Road, knowing Road is going into Sephora so that this gets Elf product there. That's not the case at all. Sephora only deals with exclusives. So given the fact that you can buy Elf products at Walmart, Target, Dollar General, Urban Outfitters, and Ulta, there's no way that Sephora is ever going to carry an Elf Product. For an L product. That doesn't really work. More importantly, if you're Rode, right, Hayley Bieber's company, and you know that you're about to probably double or triple your business via a successful launch at Sephora, why not just wait 12 months? You might be able to get $3 billion for the business. So you sell it right before this massive growth spurt? It doesn't make any sense. It tells you that the infrastructure doesn't exist to maximize that Sephora opportunity and they want out at a high inflated multiple without taking any of the risk, which tells you that they've got to have some degree of discomfort or uncertainty about how successful these SKUs are going to be there versus how successful they've been on the line.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:59:08] I do kind of disagree with that, but one wrinkle I have there is that I love Hayley Beamer. I don't know if she's looking at a level of intelligence, but you are. And her difference between a billion...  

 

Speaker 3 [01:59:28] She's not the CEO, she's just a race. No, no, the two people who run road are really smart people. Is that right? Okay. Yeah, the fact that there's a... That's the model. This was not Haley Ebert's decision like, hey, somebody offered me a billion dollars. Just gonna go to the same thing with honest. With honest. Exactly. And it was a diss... Right. And that was a disaster.  

 

Speaker 6 [01:59:54] I know nothing.  

 

Speaker 3 [01:59:55] She's got a fair bit of equity and control over this. Am I wrong about this? No, no, she has equity, but she wasn't an operating executive. There were two executives.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:00:06] Forget operating stuff. I mean, he made the decision. It was him, right?  

 

Speaker 7 [02:00:11] I don't... I actually doubt it was her. I think she... What she probably cared about was a billion dollar headline number. That's my point. Who had the trigger pull ability to say yes to the team? Yeah, probably not. She may have a say in a change of control, but I think otherwise... I think she probably has ownership over her likeness and usability of her brand or her personal brand.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:00:39] I thought this was like a, uh, uh...  

 

Speaker 7 [02:00:43] Situation.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:00:44] Where she was actually the person who said yes or no to the deal. I would doubt it. I don't think so, yeah.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:00:52] That's not my understanding at all. I think this was a rational business decision by two executives in conjunction with her and I'll guarantee you that they raised some outside capital.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:01:06] And you know what, Hayley Bieber is going to go to the next set of entrepreneurs that are like, hey we have this hot new product, it's going to be a billion dollar exit. A beverage.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:01:15] Eggs or, or, we just need to pay on it and we'll give you a quarter of the cup for...  

 

Speaker 5 [02:01:21] A lot of you is better than that, sir.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:01:24] Yeah, okay, and she had a massive set.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:01:28] Man, they had a quarter of the company? I don't think that's unreasonable.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:01:33] It's not a massive same, there's two other people that have a quarter of a quarter of the people that own your joint. There's two others people with 25% each.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:01:42] I just need a hundred million dollars and-  

 

Speaker 4 [02:01:48] I don't even know the difference between the two of them.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:01:54] I don't think they care. They care about the media coverage that comes out of it and the ability to go and do this again. That's kind of my point, so like that means you had 25% saying yes, so... But then from that perspective, this is a no-fucking-brainer deal. Any exit that looks good, you do it.  

 

Speaker 5 [02:02:12] Out of my  

 

Speaker 3 [02:02:13] My point is that most of these companies, most of the small companies, generally exit near the top. That's why I gave my brother-in-law's opinion, right? He is a serious, skilled businessman. And he had the final say on whether Sobe was sold or not. And he picked the almost exact right time to sell that company. And you could say to yourself, well, Pepsi would have blown it up. I mean, they're ACV. For Shobi at that time was like 70 percent and real ACV for a Pepsi or a Coca-Cola bottling system is 98 percent. 98 percent of available facings will have a Coke product or a Pepsi product or a Monster product and they were at 70 so there was plenty of growth left. Why did he decide to sell at that point, and why was that product not even existing three years later? It's the same thing. There will be no road in three years, in my opinion. It will have disappeared. Ailey Bieber will have either moved on or lost popularity.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:03:28] It's like six months from now.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:03:30] We didn't play out of health in six months. Is the $20 stock still like in your, or did that get pushed out a little bit because?  

 

Speaker 3 [02:03:40] I mean, the risk is that they've added $600 million worth of debt, right? So growth companies that suddenly devise kind of a quasi-roll-up strategy, but do it through debt, I mean they are adding an element of financial risk to the business that did not exist before. But right now, it's a fast-growing business. They haven't closed the road deal yet. So right now it's fast- growing consumer products company with operational risk from fast growth, but no financial risk aside from inventory management. Now, it's got operational risk for the fast growth. It's got execution risk around implementing and integrating this acquisition. And it's not financial risk because it's $600 million worth of debt. And they are gonna have to channel fill all of the Sephora stores, which means building a significant amount of inventory, which is a cash outflow. So you've gone from one risk to three risks. I mean, I still see a lot of downside here. The stock is $116. I mean it's up 87% in the last three months.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:05:05] Your ICR deck was 170 pages long. For a cosmetic company, you don't need 170 pages to convince people what you do. I'm just going to throw that out there. It's a very big marketing deck. 170 pages for ICR. I've talked to a lot of people and they've all been like, this is ridiculous.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:05:33] There are, look, there are recounting issues here. If you go back, I mean, Muddy Waters put out a relatively small deck. They pitched this at Zone London, right? I was symbol before Carson and those guys, but he pitched it at Zone, London. And it's interesting because if you look at the, if you looked at the. 95% of their sourcing is from China, right? So part of the reason that the stock was down so much was not just that the track data had fallen off as much as it did, but Liberation Day obviously blew their model apart. And the minute that they started to defer the tariffs, the stock went on this massive short squeeze rally. And that's the 87 odd percent. But what Carson did was he pulled some of the data on shipping, some of the customs data, because that's all public. You just have to know where to look to find it. And he was seeing that the sales were dropping dramatically during a period when the company was out on the road talking about how strong their business was and that the weakness in the track channels was really due to some of the things that your friend was talking about, you know, the weak tax returns and the weather issues and things like that. So the company came out to refute Carson's point and said, no, we asked customs to take all of our shipping. Numbers off because we didn't want our competitors to see how much product we were shipping, exporting out of China to the U.S. And a good friend of mine who's on the sell side but has uncovered a number of frauds over the years and a number those companies had China sourcing and sold in the United States said that there's only one company that he's ever covered. That actually went and asked Customs to take the numbers off because they were worried about competitors looking at the data. And that was Newskin, six months before Newskin absolutely imploded. He said, you don't do that. He said competitors aren't out there trying to count how many SKUs are coming into the U.S. Because we all get the track channel data. Right? You don't think Estee Lauder, Cody, Maybelline, and Revlon all get track channel data? They get it because they contribute their own data to it. So they don't need to go and look at the customs data that's being shipped over here. So something's funky. And then Carson told me that he went, he said, we really felt like... They had sort of publicly refuted our claims. So he said we went and we sourced four of the manufacturing facilities in China where they actually produce the product and we said are your sales, are your production numbers lower of the ELF product? Trying to square the actual ship data with the production data and they were like yes we're producing less of the Elf product. So there are a lot of rumors that there's a lot of Elf product that was shipped into retail. It didn't sell, and those retailers have return rights. When that product gets shipped into retail, Elf recognizes the sales. But if there's the charge back, then they have to dump the product, and that's why you're seeing the product show up in the Philippines, you're showing the product show up Saudi Arabia. And they've never disclosed that they have any retailer relationships in the Philippines or Saudi Arabia. They told us that they had distribution in retail in Germany, in Italy, and we've confirmed that. Like the German department stores where ELF is available. There's an online and Italian retail chain that's like Walgreens or a Boots, and we've confirmed that they have products. So anytime ELF sets up an overseas agreement to sell through retail, they press release it. So it's easy to check, is that a legitimate business? But if that's the case, why is their product in the Philippines? They've never publicly disclosed that they have anybody... Selling their product in the Philippines, Saudi Arabia etc. So we think that they've aggressively recognized the revenue and then the product comes back to them that doesn't and then they dump it in the grain markets offshore.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:10:24] Yeah, so this is where capital is building.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:10:26] CRUSH  

 

Speaker 9 [02:10:29] Yes  

 

Speaker 3 [02:10:31] So I just think that there are a whole slew of things here. There are a slew different real red flags. And I mean, part of the job of a short seller is just to total up red flags, but fewer red flags? OK, it could be overvalued, but it's a clean story. And the more red flags the more you have to wonder if the numbers are real. And in this particular case, I think there are a lot of red flags, and I think they're very skilled at how they present numbers. I mean, they pulled guidance when they reported numbers, and they reported the road acquisition. By the time they come back and say, well, we have enough visibility to provide guidance, they will be able to incorporate the road growth, and people will say, wow, numbers went up. But it was all a function of this acquisition, which I think is very high-risk, but they're very clever. I mean, they are a very worthy adversary for a short-time. They are. I don't think their CFO is good. I think their CEO is maybe a little too clever by a half. But I mean, up 87% and now with those three risks, the operational risk, the execution risk, and the financial risk, it's a different story than it was three months ago.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:11:59] Poor earnings, they came out with a one dollar price increase. Maybe it was a ball on the opposite side.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:12:05] All is high on the options now, just given the rush.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:12:09] Giving them a run. So anyway, that's just sort of an update. I got involved with this about 18 months ago when the stock was...  

 

Speaker 3 [02:12:20] Was vertical and I was in a Family Dollar doing store visits on Family Dollar and I saw this Elf product and I immediately knew that Elf had no relationship with Family Dollar and i thought why is Elf a product here and it wasn't one huge, it was like an entire shelf of product and then I you know quickly went and looked at the inventory and the inventory was exploding. And I started doing more store visits saying, something doesn't make sense here. I mean, if this is the hottest beauty product around for young women.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:12:57] Why is it in Family Dollar?  

 

Speaker 3 [02:13:01] Like, why isn't it blowing out of Ulta, blowing out of Target, blowing our of Walmart? And now they've decided to sell through Dollar General? Like, there is no easier way to blow your grand value than to sell at a Dollar General.  

 

Speaker 5 [02:13:19] Nice to meet you.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:13:25] Yeah, they were, like, all of these celebrity brands were stealing from mass. And you're talking about mass? Yeah, like MC, all that. So there's like Selena's, Rhodes, there was another one, right, like I forget what Selena I don't know how to translate this, but it's like a prayer for you to hear something.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:13:45] And then there's 17.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:13:46] Yeah, so we hosted at Cherie's in Gilead Beauty not long ago, who were helping all the support. It's like, the person we hosted basically was like, mass is seeing share loss, just mass generally, to the celebrity brands, because they're like $5 to $10 more expensive, but they have a celebrity backing, they're a better cosmetic brand, so they're slightly  

 

Speaker 3 [02:14:16] That's right. But remember this, there was a period six or seven years ago where every celebrity had a fragrance. You remember the Elizabeth Taylor fragrance? It was advertised nonstop and they were all available through LulzHot. How many of those celebrity fragrance brands still exist today? Almost none. Right, Dolly Parton had one, any two bits of Dolly, Jessica Simpson, Jessica Simpson had one. I mean, there, but Jessica Simpson had a very fine.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:14:50] Brother, brother, brother.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:14:53] What is it? Edible, like, uh, bath products.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:14:56] So that's that shit.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:15:00] She did have that, that is true, that definitely was a surprise, but I will tell you that these celebrity brands, right, I mean...  

 

Speaker 9 [02:15:08] They just want to make money, they want to use their brand properly, they wanna make money but like, they're not buying it.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:15:12] It's just, you wonder about the durability, right? Very few of these celebrity brands have ever really proven themselves to be durable, growth products. They're flash, they're flashes in the pan. And, I mean, more power to the celebrity, right, if they hit the market right, they can make, I mean look at this guy, Ryan Reynolds, everything he touches seems to turn to gold. Right? But he sells them off. That's right. And he sells him off. He makes the wrong money. No, he's... George Clooney has sold off, you know, his brand.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:15:46] Beaver needs to stay relevant, right, and you have a husband, unfortunately, that seems to be going in the hermit direction, like he's got, right? So like, they don't seem to be people that are going out and being seen in public all the time, and like, that's not good for the road. Well, and there'll be some news.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:16:03] Well, and there'll be some new celebrity, right, that'll come across, and all the young girls will be enamored. I mean, look, you talked about Match, right? And Match probably got itself into trouble in some part by this whole Gen Z influence, right? So a lot of the time, when we try to think about moats in business... I mean, that's why some of these luxury franchises are what they are, because they sell to someone who is established in their career, established in their wealth. And have that disposable income to spend on that particular product and they're brand loyal. Whereas a young person usually doesn't have the money and they have not developed brand loyalty yet. They're jumping around trying out different products. So if your elf or your road and your customer base is an eight-year-old girl to a 20-year You have... You have disposable income related risks and you have just flight risk where there's no brand loyalty towards that product except at that moment and if something sexier comes along, everybody pivots.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:17:23] Right, well, he's like not a thing anymore, and we're gonna do that for everything.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:17:29] So that's a big risk, I think, in this one.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:17:34] But I thought it was interesting that I was having this conversation because my kid was asking my wife, who was in Nashville at the beginning of the week, for Taylor Swift lipstick, right, because she always wears red lipstick, but Taylor Swift does not license her name to anything.  

 

Speaker 5 [02:17:51] Smart.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:17:54] I mean, she doesn't need the money, let's put it that way, but she might soon after she just shelled out, whatever. Yeah, $3.50 for the match. We're masters, but we're ready for sex.  

 

Speaker 5 [02:18:06] Well, yeah, she'll be okay. I feel good about that.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:18:15] To the left side, if she went out and made a lip gloss, roads would get crushed.  

 

Speaker 3 [02:18:20] Every brand would get crushed.  

 

Speaker 9 [02:18:25] I just fucking walked out. Yeah, I noticed that. I was watching that. I was just watching you guys. The guy that turfed it in his chair. Oh yeah, no, not a chance. He was like, there's no chance that was his daughter, because a daughter would have been like fucking all over the pot. She would have jumped over the table. Unless his daughter hit the gut. In which case you have a worse problem in life. The girl is still here. The guy walked out...  

 

Speaker 7 [02:18:54] And then the girl's like, wait, and then she got the leftover food from the thing, and now she's talking about the girl right now, she's like... Right now  

 

Speaker 4 [02:19:03] Well, yeah, but usually  

 

Speaker 7 [02:19:16] Okay, okay, honestly, he fucking fell out of his fucking car. That guy went down hard. Yeah, you know.  

 

Speaker 5 [02:19:22] I'm not saying it! Did you see it? I just saw it. We saw the aftermath. I only saw the aftermath.  

 

Speaker 7 [02:19:31] I'll tell you after that, we better not get up in the chair. I'm going to give you a shift.  

 

Speaker 5 [02:19:35] Oh, oh, it's like... Oh my god, oh my god. We need to do that over there. Okay, we... Excuse me, I don't know. I'd like this captured. I'd just like this capture.  

 

Speaker 4 [02:19:54] Ivan! Ivan! Your chairs are fucked up here, dude. Which one? Your chair! I chair everyone! Don't hate everyone! Only everyone!

My daughter, if I fell on the ground, if my daughter didn't come to hear me. Did you see what just happened? You saw it. That's your daughter. Your daughter didn't get up? Oh my god. What's happening? What are you doing? That's the daughter. That's her daughter. That's a disaster. Alright, Ronnie, what happens next?
