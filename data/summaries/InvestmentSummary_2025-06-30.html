<span class='rest'>— Narrative Summary</span></h2>
<pre>**TDC — Long — 10/25/2023 — $22**

• Teradata has been a challenging investment, with a history of underperformance and a recent drop from $32 to $22.
  - The company has a strong maintenance business and a new CFO with a track record of selling to private equity.

  - Private equity could value the company north of $34 per share.
• Teradata's technology is crucial for real-time fraud alerts and compliance work, which are essential services for its clients.
• Despite its recurring revenue model, the company's growth has been hindered by its inability to expand beyond its core structured data offerings.
• The stock is seen as undervalued, with potential upside if the company can capitalize on AI adoption and improve its cloud business participation.
