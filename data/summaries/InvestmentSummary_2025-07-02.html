<pre>**Lionsgate (LGF.A, LGF.B) — Facts**

**Financials:**
- Lionsgate historically hasn't worked well for shareholders. The company was a rocket ship in the past, with buy-out offers that didn't pan out.
- In 2016, they acquired a cable network and a small streaming business called Starz for $4.4 billion, which turned out to be a disastrous acquisition due to cord-cutting trends.
- The company decided to separate into two distinct publicly traded companies, a process that started in 2022 and finished a month ago. Now, there are two companies: Lionsgate (the studio business) and Starz (SDRZ).
- Last year, Lionsgate had a massive flop called Borderlands, which led to significant financial losses. Traditionally, they run a de-risked model with 23% IRRs on films.
- The company is guiding to flat EBITDA growth year-over-year, with a potential path to 350-400 million EBITDA. A low to mid-teens EBITDA multiple could double the stock.
- Precedent M&A multiples in studios are higher than the low to mid-teens EBITDA multiple. For example, Amazon bought MGM at 20-something times EBITDA.

**Governance:**
- The governance has been massively improved with the split. The dual-class share structure was collapsed, reducing the largest shareholder's voting power from 24% to 13%.
- The largest shareholder, who has been in the company since 2009, is not a seller, and everyone on Wall Street reportedly hates him.
- The new Lionsgate entity has yet to name a chairman.

**Strategic Interests:**
- There are supposedly strategic interests in the company, and management seems like they are sellers in the next 12 months.
- Steve Mnuchin, a former movie business executive, has been buying up stock and now owns 12.6% of the company. There is speculation he wants to buy the company.

**Operational:**
- The studio business is compared to a pharma company, where the production side is volatile, but the IP library is monetized under long-term recurring revenue licensing contracts at a high margin.
- The library IP licensing accounts for 30% of revenue but 80-90% of profits.

**Market Position:**
- Lionsgate has a library of 20,000 titles, including franchises like John Wick, Hunger Games, Now You See Me, and Twilight.

**AI Use Cases:**
- AI is expected to revolutionize the studio business in pre-production, post-production, library optimization, and marketing efficiency. AI can save 5-20% of time and cost on a tentpole movie.

**Challenges:**
- The company had a terrible year due to the Borderlands flop and leftover COVID and strike impacts.
- The company is facing negative sentiment and technical governance barriers, which have been reset.

**Outlook:**
- The company is expected to perform better with a new slate and no losses, potentially reaching 350-400 million EBITDA.
- There is an expectation of strategic interest and potential sale, which could lead to a bidding war and higher multiples.</pre>
