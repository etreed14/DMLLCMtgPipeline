STAGE C — BUILD FINAL OUTPUT (clean + append stats)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For each company **in the same order as Stage A**:

1. **Final A cleanup**  
   • Re-scan every Stage A bullet you produced.  
   • If a bullet still contains multiple ideas joined by “;”, “ and ”, or “ but ”:  
     – Split at that join-word.  
     – Keep the first idea as the parent bullet.  
     – Indent the remaining idea(s) exactly one level deeper.  
   • _Do not reorder, merge, or delete any content._ Only split & indent.

2. **Print the Stage A header and its cleaned bullet tree.**

3. **Append Quick-Stats / Metrics**
